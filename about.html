  <h1>About.</h1>
  <p class="intro">
  My name is Ali Haddi I am a 21 year old artist based in Boston, MA.</p>

  <p class="education">BA/BFA Combined Degree student pursuing a BA in Child Study & Human Development and a BFA in Visual Arts with a concentration in Animation and Media. I enjoy working in creative environments that foster teamwork and collaboration. Areas that interest me are Children's Media, Video Game Design, 2D Animation, and storytelling.</p>

  <p class="practice">I was first introduced to the art world through making paintings. Throughout all of highschool I worked at a painting studio
  in Boston where I produced paintings for a company to sell. From there I went into photography and then eventually into
  time based mediums. From there my practice has evolved to include everything from audio-reactive visuals to small jewelry
  making.</p>
